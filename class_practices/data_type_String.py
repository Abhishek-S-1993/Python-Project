"""string is sequence of elements which can be alphabet, numeric and alphanumeric,
which is represented between double quotation """

# string is immutable

"""the declaring the string and converting the String value to int value and int value to String value"""

x = "10"
print(x)
print(type(x))

# converting to int

con_x = int(x)
type_x = type(con_x)
print("the value of x is{}".format(type_x))

# converting to str

con_y = str(con_x)
type_y = type(con_y)
print("the value of y is {}".format(type_y))

print( 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3)
